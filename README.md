# Project: Interactive AI Assistant with AWS Lambda, Bedrock, and DynamoDB

This project demonstrates how to build a multi-functional, conversational AI assistant using a serverless AWS architecture. The assistant can be controlled via text messages (SMS/MMS) and is capable of analyzing images, answering questions, and managing a personal to-do list.

## Features

*   **AI Image Analysis:** Send an image (MMS) and receive a description of what the AI sees in it.
*   **Conversational Q&A:** Ask general knowledge questions and get answers generated by a powerful large language model.
*   **To-Do List Management:** Add, view, and remove items from a personal to-do list, which is stored persistently for each user.

## High-Level Architecture

This project uses an API-driven, event-based architecture:

1.  **User Input (SMS/MMS):** A user sends a text or an image to a dedicated phone number (managed by a service like Amazon Pinpoint or Twilio).
2.  **API Gateway:** The messaging service forwards the incoming message to an **Amazon API Gateway** endpoint. This provides a secure, scalable entry point for our application.
3.  **Router Lambda Function:** The API Gateway triggers a central **AWS Lambda function**. This "router" is the core of the application and performs these key tasks:
    *   It parses the incoming request to get the user's phone number, message text, and any media URLs.
    *   It determines the user's **intent** (e.g., are they asking a question, sending an image, or managing their to-do list?).
4.  **Backend Logic & Services:** Based on the intent, the router Lambda calls the appropriate AWS service:
    *   For **image analysis**, it uses **Amazon Rekognition**.
    *   For **answering questions**, it invokes a foundation model via **Amazon Bedrock**.
    *   For **to-do lists**, it reads from or writes to an **Amazon DynamoDB** table, using the user's phone number as the primary key.
5.  **Response:** The Lambda function formats a user-friendly reply and sends it back through the API Gateway to the messaging service, which delivers it to the user as a text message.

## AWS Services Used

*   **Amazon API Gateway:** To create, publish, and secure our application's API endpoint.
*   **AWS Lambda:** For serverless compute, running our central "router" logic.
*   **Amazon Bedrock:** To access foundation models for generative AI and question-answering.
*   **Amazon Rekognition:** For AI-powered image analysis.
*   **Amazon DynamoDB:** To provide a persistent, serverless NoSQL database for storing user-specific to-do lists.
*   **AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management):** For securely managing permissions between all the services.
*   **(External) Amazon Pinpoint or Twilio:** For receiving and sending SMS/MMS messages.

## Setup and Deployment

*(This section will be your guide as you build)*

1.  **Configure a Phone Number:** Set up a number with a service like Twilio and configure its webhook to point to your future API Gateway URL.
2.  **Create a DynamoDB Table:** Design and create a table to store to-do lists.
3.  **Create an IAM Role:** Build a Lambda execution role with permissions for API Gateway, Lambda, Rekognition, Bedrock, and DynamoDB.
4.  **Develop the Lambda Function:** Write the Python code for the "router" logic.
5.  **Deploy the API and Lambda:** Create the API Gateway endpoint and connect it to your Lambda function.

## How to Use

*(Once deployed, you will interact with it like this)*

*   **To get image labels:** Send an image to the phone number.
*   **To ask a question:** Text something like, `What is the largest planet in our solar system?`
*   **To add a to-do:** Text `add buy groceries` or `todo + pick up dry cleaning`.
*   **To view your list:** Text `show my list` or `list todos`.
*   **To remove a to-do:** Text `remove 1` to delete the first item on your list.
